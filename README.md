# Resources for scRNAseq data analysis

This repo describes R scripts to conduct analysis of single cell RNA-seq data. They were developed as part of an informal series of workshops designed to introduce PhD students and postdocs to scRNAseq analysis. Topics covered include: data import, normalization, feature selection, projection, clustering and differential expression.
